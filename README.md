# Welcome to my Portfolio!

### Here, you'll discover the various ways in which I have used SQL & Python for problem solving and wrangling data.

## Project 1 - COVID 19 Deaths Analysis**
  - Converting string 'N/A' values in cells to NULL
  - Analyze the following:
    * The number of people who tested positive for Covid 19 by State
    * Which region has the most Hospitalizations of patients with COVID 19 in the past week
    * Which states are in Region 5 to determine where we need to support hospital staff
    * Change in new hospital admissions over the prior week to see how much it's fluctuated in each region
    * Which states are in that area to see if it's densely populated
    * Which region has the most hospital admissions since early on in the Pandemic (Aug 2020)
    * What percentage of these cases resulted in death during the past week by state (exclude supressed data)
    * Death Rate over the last 3 months to get a bigger picture into recent events
    * Total Deaths are for each state to see if these 3 states have remained fairly consistent over the trajectory of this dataset
    * The percentage of people who died of Covid 19 out of the people who tested positive for Covid 19 by State

## Project 2 - House Project**
  - This project is to showcase the ways in which you can clean data for a Housing Dataset.
  - Based on the dataset found on the [CDC's website] (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_percent-covid-deaths).
  - Includes the following:
  -   Populating missing data fields
  -   Splitting Addresses into Street Address, City, State Columns
  -   Updating text strings
  -   Removing duplicates
  -   Deleting unnecessary columns
